    <b>Physics in a Summit </b>
  </div>
  
  
  <div class="section-body">
  
    <p>Prior to college, I was never exceptionally good at physics or math and was always more interested in the liberal arts, primarily philosophy. I even planned to attend college as a philosophy major during my junior year of high school as I read up on the subject in my free time. At that time, however, I had not yet identified the specific questions that I found most interesting and would want to pursue in such a degree. With the onset of the pandemic and its lockdowns, though, I was allowed more time to read on my own and eventually became interested in questions that dealt with the origin of the universe, the nature of reality, and the nature of consciousness. As I continued to read and think about these questions, I realized that they are now questions better suited for physicists to ask more rigorously and possibly provide partial answers to. At this point, I recognized that if I was serious about pursuing these sorts of questions, attending college for a degree in physics would be a prerequisite.         </p>
  
    <p>Deciding to apply for college as a physics major after having spent my life unconvinced of my ability in the subject meant I would need to revisit the math I had forgotten and learn physics from the ground up. As my junior year of high school was ending, I began independently reviewing the trigonometry and algebra I had forgotten and worked out basic physics problems. To properly prepare myself for a degree in physics, I recognized that taking calculus and calculus-based physics in my senior year would be crucial. Not already on track to be able to take these classes, I enrolled in a precalculus class over the summer and continued my independent study. When I applied to colleges, I primarily considered liberal arts schools with strong physics departments, which led me to Carthage College.  </p>
  
  
    <p> During the summer before my freshman year of college, I set out to complete a very demanding hike with my best friend from high school, his dad, and his cousin. We planned to hike Minnesota's Superior Hiking Trail, which follows the shore of Lake Superior and is 310 miles in length, in just a week. Given the time constraint, we planned to be hiking around forty miles every day. I ended up only being able to take three days of this, having to rest on the fourth day and begin reducing my mileage in the remaining days, which slowed the group down and prevented us from reaching the goal of finishing in a week. I learned for the first time how my body reacted to long physical exertions during this trip but did not feel the urge to do something like it again for a long period of time after we stopped on the seventh day. I came out of this experience knowing that this ability to endure extended periods of hard work would be at least somewhat helpful for pursuing a degree in physics, which is something I thought about while hiking, but I wasn't yet able to enjoy myself in the moment of actually engaging in this work.  </p>
  

    <p> I still didn't feel completely solid in my foundation in physics and math upon entering college, so I took Fundamental Physics and Calc 1 in the fall and General Physics 1 and Calc 2 in the spring of my freshman year. During my freshman year, I was also taking liberal arts classes and continued to read philosophy on my own time. I additionally joined Dr. Crosby's space science lab and Dr. Quashnock's gravitational waves group during this year, which was my first exposure to research and provided opportunities that laid my foundation in technical skills that I continue to use regularly. </p>
  
    <p> In my sophomore year, I was beginning to take a higher volume of physics and math classes, which left less room to take classes from the liberal arts and required that more of my free time be spent working on the classes. The sophomore-level physics and math classes began allowing more opportunities to practice technical writing and presentations, and my job in the school's writing center kept me up to date with the content of Intellectual Foundations, however. As I was moving further from the liberal arts while developing some of the general communication and presentation skills in my technical classes, I experienced the first immediate connection between physics and philosophy in the deliverance of Modern Physics. This class was my first experience with a physics class where philosophical issues were immediately apparent, which made my experience of Modern Physics the first time I can completely say I enjoyed a physics class, since this connection of fields is what initially brought me to physics.</p>
 

    <p> Following my experience at LSU's REU program during the summer between my sophomore and junior year, it became clear to me that I would enjoy theoretical research given my philosophical leanings. Because I was interested in gravity, I knew that building a foundation in general relativity would be crucial to my future success. I ended this summer by gathering resources that would allow me to teach myself the subject and began making steps toward this goal. I was registered for an intense load of classes in the fall of my junior year, however, and knew that I would have to deal with a large workload in order to allow myself time to work on this project in addition to having to deal with my nerves that grew as the semester got closer. I'll never forget the night before I drove to Carthage for the fall semester of my junior year. For the first time in my life, I laid awake in bed due to the nerves I had thinking about the intense load of classes I was going to be taking. </p>


    <p>The fall semester of my junior year was no joke, and I was justified to have experienced those nerves before it began. I learned a wide amount of physics and math during this time and continued to develop the skill of technical writing, especially in Dr. Anderson's Thermal Physics class. I made a surprisingly large amount of progress on my goal of teaching myself general relativity during this time and spent countless hours at the whiteboards in the math lab working on homework and moving on to general relativity when I was done. Looking back on this semester, I dealt with the sort of extended periods of intense work that I first dealt with in that hike before entering college, and even began to enjoy this process. I was moving into the applications of general relativity to black holes, gravitational waves, and cosmology as the J-Term of my junior year began. The large final written report assigned in Dr. Anderson's Experimental Physics class during this J-Term allowed me a great opportunity to make use of the content I had learned over the last semester and the more interesting applications I was just beginning to learn about at the time. This became a review paper on general relativity and cosmology and has been the longest writing project I have engaged in, besides my theses.  </p>


    <p>The intense work of my junior fall semester followed by a considerable project undertaken during that year's J-Term in addition to the large number of REU applications I wrote during this time burned me out at the beginning of the spring semester, which was a state I had not dealt with before. I was thankfully still able to keep up with my challenging spring semester, and even began working on a problem in theoretical physics for the first time with Dr. Anderson. In the summer following my junior year, I was accepted to Penn State's REU program, where I worked on a theoretical project in quantum information and open quantum systems. Not having taken at the time, I again made use of this developing ability to work hard on something for an extended period of time and spent the first few weeks quickly learning the Dirac formalism of quantum mechanics, the relevant quantum information theory, and moved on to the theory content that was more directly relevant to my work in a surprisingly short amount of time.  </p>

    <p>After this experience ended and before my senior year began, I went on to attempt another physically demanding task with the same high school friend. We planned to hike around ten of the western Colorado fourteeners in the span of a week. During the trip, we experienced some problems in finding the correct mountains (which was largely my own fault), so we were only able to summit five of the seven mountains we attempted in the week. I don't believe that this trip was any less demanding than the previous hike we took up in the summer before my freshman year and I didn't feel any more physically fit than I was on our hike, but I felt much more able to deal with the prolonged summits. I don't believe the mental endurance developed in an academic context is completely removed from that of a physical context, such as our climbs, and I believe that a part of my success can be attributed to the endurance developed as a physics major at Carthage. During this trip, I also found myself enjoying the long hours of hiking, which I again partially attribute to my experience as a physics major, through which I have learned how doing difficult work for long periods of time can be a somewhat enjoyable process.  </p>

    <p>In my senior fall, I'm not being continuously crushed by classes as I was in the previous fall, so I have been able to dedicate lots of time to working on my GRFP and grad school applications. At this point in my life, I have a clear idea of the sort of physics I would like to work on, am sure that I would like to pursue a graduate degree in the field, and feel that my technical preparation in combination with my developed ability to work hard for prolonged periods of time and my soft skills developed at Carthage will support me in this goal.  </p>

    <p>I initially turned to pursue physics because of its ability to rigorously address fundamental philosophical questions that have plagued philosophers for centuries and my path through the field over the last four years has been influenced by this motivation.  found the historical and philosophical context provided in my physics classes, especially Modern Physics, to be a surprisingly rewarding and engaging aspect of my time as a physics major at Carthage. This integration of the liberal arts with physics is a perspective I have started incorporating into my own presentations and plan to continue developing further. I'm very glad to have developed a solid foundation in technical writing and to have made such large improvements in my public speaking while at Carthage, which unexpectedly are skills that I have primarily developed in my physics and math classes, but have also been developed in my liberal arts classes. I believe my physics education has also allowed me to develop an endurance towards difficult tasks in life and through it, I have come to appreciate the process involved in such activities, whether they be intellectual or physical. I believe this development is captured well by the two trips which came as I was about to begin college and when I was close to finishing. Looking back on my motivations for becoming a physics major, I knew at the time that such a path would be difficult, but I didn't directly identify at the time that I was at least partially interested in it for this reason. I also believe that this perspective on difficult work will serve me well in graduate school and in whatever work I'm able to do after I earn my PhD, preferably a professorship.  </p>
